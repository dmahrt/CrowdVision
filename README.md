# CrowdVision


Have you ever been to a concert or party, and wished you could keep the photos everyone else was taking? Wouldn't it be nice if there was an album that everyone was able to share? Crowd Vision is a platform for creating crowdsourced photo albums centered around social events. 

You start by giving your event a title, location and an ending date, and the photo album will remain open to users at that location until the event is over. Users can continue contributing to the album, building a unique record of your event that you can easily view at any time.

In addition to creating your own events, you can see other active events in your own city, ongoing events in other cities, as well as events that are over.


**Features:**
- Photo albums that lock after events are over
- Only users near the event can contribute
- Set up a new event in seconds
- Real-time updates to each event
- Filter to only see events near you

**Todo:**
- Search for events
- Set favorite events
